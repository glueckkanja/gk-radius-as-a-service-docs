# Windows

No matter which certificate type you are deploying, make sure to import your Server Certificate as trusted root as described [here](../trusted-root.md#to-add-a-trusted-root-profile-for-your-clients).

## Certificate Type

For Windows Devices there are two options to create the WiFi Policy and it depends on User or Device certificates which you are deploying which needs to be used.

If User certificates where deployed, follow the steps under [User Certificates](windows.md#user-certificates). With [Device Certificates](windows.md#device-certificates), use the WiFi XML which you get in your [Portal](../../portal/settings-trusted-roots/xml.md#wifi).

### Device Certificates 

The following list and screenshot show you all necessary configurations:

1. Log in to your [Azure portal](https://porta.azure.com)
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Intune\(Endpoint Manager\)** -&gt; **Devices** -&gt; **Windows**  -&gt; **Configuration profiles**
3. Then click **Create Profile**
4. As **Platform** select **Windows 8.1 and later**

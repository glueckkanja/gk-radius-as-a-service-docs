# Licensing

## General

#### How we count users

Our licensing model allows you to assign as many devices as you want to an individual user. For us, only the user counts. Typically, the number of users you have to consider corresponds to the number of active users in your Azure AD that have access to devices that may leverage our RADIUSaaS.

#### Limitations

* The minimum amount of user that can be licensed is 50.
* It is not possible to distribute the licensed amount of users between different end customers.

#### Pricing Model

* Every plan consists of a base fee which includes a certain amount of users per month or per year \(depending on the renewal interval of the plan\). The fee is due at the beginning of the billing cycle \(prepaid\).
* For each additional user, we charge an additional monthly or annual per-user fee, that is due during the next billing cycle \(postpaid\).
* You will be prompted for your desired \(additional\) user count on our landing page during the subscription enrolment process.
